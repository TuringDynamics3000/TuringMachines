# TuringResolve™

TuringResolve is a **decision resolution system** built on the TuringMachines platform.

## Capabilities
- Complex case resolution
- Policy-driven decisions
- Risk-aware outcomes
- Full auditability

## Non-Goals
- Not a generic workflow tool
- Not a rules engine alone
- Not opaque AI

TuringResolve composes platform engines without duplicating core logic.
