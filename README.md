# TuringMachines Platform

**Flagship Product: TuringResolve™**

TuringMachines is the core **decision-engine platform** underpinning Turing products.
It provides governed, auditable, event-driven intelligence engines for regulated
decisioning environments.

## Products

### TuringResolve™
TuringResolve is the primary commercial product built on the TuringMachines platform.
It composes policy, investigation, risk intelligence, orchestration, and settlement
engines into a unified resolution system for credit, compliance, disputes, and
regulatory workflows.

## Platform Engines

The platform contains reusable engines including:

- Policy & rules evaluation
- Risk intelligence (RiskBrain)
- Investigation & evidence analysis
- Capture & signal ingestion
- Orchestration & workflow control
- Settlement & enforcement logic

These engines are **platform assets**, not product-specific implementations.

## Architectural Principle

Products (such as TuringResolve) are **wrappers over the platform — never the other
way around**.
