## Value Proposition

### Problem Statement
Modern banks and fintechs invest heavily in sleek front-end apps and user experiences, but the critical "back-office" infrastructure - fraud detection, risk scoring, identity verification, document processing, reconciliation, settlement, audit trails, and regulatory compliance - remains **fragmented, outdated, and spread across multiple vendors**. This creates operational risk, slows down product development, increases costs, and accumulates technical/regulatory debt.

### Solution
Stakk provides a **single, unified infrastructure layer** that integrates all these essential but "boring" operational functions (fraud, risk, identity, orchestration, ledger sync, document capture, compliance, etc.), allowing financial institutions and fintechs to offload mission-critical backend workflows and focus instead on customer-facing innovation.

### Key Benefits
1. **Increased Revenue**: Embedding financial services increases conversion rates and average order value
2. **Enhanced Customer Experience**: Eliminates friction - users don't leave platform for loans, identity verification, or payments
3. **Improved Operational Efficiency**: Automating KYC, credit checks, accounts payable frees up resources, reduces manual errors, accelerates business operations
4. **Reduced Risk & Compliance Burden**: Specialized partner manages regulatory overhead instead of building/maintaining complex compliance systems in-house

## Technical Architecture

### Platform Characteristics
- **Modular**: Clients pick and choose modules (Capture IQ, Risk IQ, Auth IQ, Flow IQ, Settle IQ)
- **API-First**: Deep technical embedding via APIs/SDKs
- **Configurable**: Program config keeps features flexible, simple, modular
- **Developer-Friendly**: API docs, SDKs, simplified onboarding
- **Highly Secure**: Encrypted storage with ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability)

### Distribution Strategy
1. Direct enterprise sales targeting banks, fintechs, and platforms
2. Channel partnerships with core processors, integrators, and infrastructure providers
3. OEM and white-label arrangements embedding Stakk IQ™ natively into third-party platforms
4. Developer-driven adoption through API documentation, SDKs, and simplified onboarding

## Competitive Moat

**"Our years of operational experience within embedded financial flows has generated unique, high-quality datasets that competitors cannot replicate. Once our Stakk IQ™ modules are fully integrated deeply into a client's application and operations, removal is cost-prohibitive, providing strong switching barriers."**
